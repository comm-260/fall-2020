I"Ï<p>In most American elections, between 35 and 60 percent of eligible voters will not cast a ballot, however, this yearâ€™s turnout broke a nearly century long record. More Americans voted in the 2020 presidential election than any other election in 120 years. Even amidst a   consequential pandemic, approximately 159 million people voted according to the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/">United States Election Project</a>, a turnout-tracking database run by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.</p>

<p>Despite American elections having a tendency for low turnout, this year was already anticipated to have high numbers of people showing up to the polls. Data Reporter for FiveThirtyEight, Nathaniel Rakich notes that the 2018 midterm elections were a key indicator of a change brewing in the American voter base.</p>
