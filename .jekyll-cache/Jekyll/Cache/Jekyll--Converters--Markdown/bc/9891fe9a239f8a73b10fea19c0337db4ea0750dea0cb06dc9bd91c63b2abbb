I"+'<p>“I had a hamburger for lunch today”</p>

<p>This may seem like a casual response, but for domestic abuse survivors, this sentence could save their life.</p>

<p>The sentence has been translated to “my abuser is in the next room.”</p>

<p>Code words and discretion are the realities of domestic abuse survivors.
Sex abuse cases are decreasing in DC during the Coronavirus pandemic in comparison to years prior. Although this seems to be an improvement, the focus of the pandemic has made domestic violence less of a priority. The decrease in calls to Child Protective Services to report sexual abuse this year shows how abuse isn’t noticed as often when everyone is quarantined at home.</p>

<p>The biggest numbers of focus currently are reported in Coronavirus cases. As of October 2, DC has had 15,186 positive cases.</p>

<p>As Coronavirus cases rise, domestic abuse cases continue to show a decrease in comparison to previous years.</p>

<p>Sexual abuse crimes are at the lowest they have been in the past nine years. A total of 143 cases have been reported this year so far.
“The statistics very rarely tell the whole story,” said Thompson.
Because of school shutdowns, working from home, and staying away from others in general, indicating domestic abuse is not as easy as it was once before.</p>

<p>“There’s a whole constellation of people that often observe and report violent behavior. And right now, most of those people are cut off from the children of the survivors that they regularly see,” said Thompson.</p>

<p>The sex abuse rate from January to October in 2019 was 2.5 cases per 10,000 residents. The rate in those same months in 2020 is lower with 2 cases per 10,000 residents.</p>

<p>Due to the Coronavirus, social work appointments are done virtually. This prevents social workers from indicating whether or not a crime has been committed. With fewer crimes being detected from virtual meetings, fewer crimes have been reported this year.</p>

<p>“We know more abuse is going on and once quarantines start to lift and once things open up again, we expect a huge influx of calls to all of those people,” said Thompson.</p>

<p>Quarantine has kept everyone inside of their homes for abnormal amounts of time. This includes survivors being kept inside with their abusers and limiting opportunities to have time away from them.</p>

<p>“Because of COVID, abuse has gone up, not down,” said Thompson. The data provided makes domestic abuse problems show improvement when there is actually a larger problem than before.</p>

<p>The pandemic has made the public’s primary goal health and safety of one another. However, the safety and health of survivors have fallen through the cracks, especially in Ward 8.</p>

<p>With the smallest population in DC, Ward 8 has one of the highest sex abuse rates out of any other ward. For every five cases in 2020, Ward 8 was responsible for two of them.</p>

<p>Although Ward 4 has the highest number of Coronavirus cases, holding 10 out of 50 cases, Ward 7 and 8 combined make up 13 out of 50 cases in DC.
The community that makes up Ward 8 faces economic challenges, which tends to lead to more violence, said Sloan Thompson, who works at the DC Coalition Against Domestic Violence as the training and outreach coordinator.</p>

<p>“Ward 8, has consistently had a higher amount of reported domestic violence incidents,” said Thompson.</p>

<p>Although Ward 8 has shown the highest reports of sex abuse in DC, they have the lowest access to domestic shelters.</p>

</script>

<p>Compared to the prior map, the amount of accessible shelters for Ward 8 survivors is low. There are three shelters in Ward 8 where the sex abuse rate is 7.85 cases per 10,000 residents. Ward 5 has four shelters and the rates are lower at 5.97 cases per 10,000 residents.</p>

<p>For some victims, choosing to find shelter in a different ward, city, or even state is the safest option for them. This could explain why there is a shortage of housing in Ward 8 for them.</p>

<p>However, some victims cannot afford to move significantly far away due to the commitments that they have in their community. This could include their job or their child’s school, said Thompson.</p>

<p>The District Alliance for Safe Housing (DASH) works to provide housing for survivors in areas outside of shelters. Although not every survivor has been housed, the transitional housing that is being offered still helps survivors leave their abuser and claim their life back.</p>

<p>The work done by the District Alliance for Safe Housing helps to compensate for the lack of domestic shelters. The transitional housing also allows for survivors to have a place to go even when domestic shelters are at max capacity.</p>

<p>DASH has a housing clinic located in DC for survivors to get in contact and find out what their options are.</p>

<p>Domestic services within DC and across the nation have been added with an extra form of safety for their survivors since the pandemic has begun.</p>

<p>DeBare worked to ensure that shelters/coalitions knew the protocols to follow in order to adjust to the pandemic and keep others safe.</p>

<p>“That primary focus has been to make sure that all the coalitions have the information they need to manage the ever-changing environment we’re in,” said Deborah DeBare, senior deputy director at the National Network to End Domestic Violence.</p>

<p>DeBare worked to ensure that shelters/coalitions knew the protocols to follow in order to adjust to the pandemic and keep others safe.
The morale of staff was also a concern for DeBare.</p>

<p>“It’s really hard to do this kind of work to begin with. But when you’re doing it in an isolated way at home, it can be really stressful,” said DeBare.</p>

<p>Michelle Gardner is a counselor at the support center for The House of Ruth, a domestic shelter in DC. Gardner works both remotely and in-person during the week currently.</p>

<p>Gardner holds meetings with her patients over Zoom. Patients are initially evaluated to see whether or not they would be safe with using zoom or needed to come in person.</p>

<p>“The therapy is appealing for many people, but, you know, it’s coming after oftentimes, months, years, a lifetime of abusive relationships,” said Gardner.</p>

<p>In a time of uncertainty, domestic abuse organizations have turned to what they can control.</p>

<p>Gardner, DeBare, and Thompson all mentioned the importance of staying educated on the topic and ensuring preventative measures are put in place.</p>

<p>“I’ve always found it really empowering to sort of, you know, do outreach,” said Gardner.</p>

<p>Outreach and education help both survivors and individuals around them. With all of the free time given due to the pandemic, learning about domestic violence can allow survivors to understand what is happening to them and keep those on the outside informed about what is happening in their community.</p>

<p>“How can we really change things if people don’t know what’s going on,” said Thompson.</p>
