I":%<p>On March 30th, 2020, Mayor Bowser issued a <a href="https://coronavirus.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-issues-stay-home-order">stay-at-home-order</a> for Washington, D.C. The order was an attempt to curb the rising numbers of COVID-19 cases across the region and the nation. A condition of the order was that residents only engage in essential travel, which included essential work and activities, such as visiting a doctor. All forms of transportation quickly declined as those who could took to a new life indoors.</p>

<p>Around this same time, Apple began tracking daily requests for directions in Apple Maps. The data served as an entry point to understanding COVID-19 mobility trends. In D.C., the mobility data illustrated the effects of COVID-19 and Bowser’s stay-at-home-order. Over time, routing requests for walking, driving, and public transit across the region collectively dropped. Some dropped more than others. Public transit requests fell significantly faster than those for walking or driving, hitting their lowest point mid-April. As COVID-19 cases in D.C. slowly receded and travel crept back up, routing requests for walking and driving increased significantly faster than requests for public transit. Nearing the end of November, public transit requests have begun to fall once more.</p>

<p>How can we account for the disparity in routing requests for public transit? The Transportation Research Board’s Executive Director Neil Pedersen said D.C. is unique in its high population of “choice riders.” While “transit captives” have no alternative to public transit, choice riders have more flexibility in their travel options, said Pedersen. Washington has a higher percentage of choice riders. “They are the ones where if people are afraid to be using a system because of COVID-19 or there are significant reductions in service, they are most likely to not come back.” D.C.’s high population of choice riders has more flexibility in their travel options and can easily turn to alternatives when public transit is no longer the safest option. This explains why routing requests for public transit dropped more than those for walking or driving.</p>

<p>Public transit in D.C. comes in two major forms: Metrobus and Metrorail. Ridership rates for both systems decreased, consistent with the Apple mobility data. More interestingly, Metrorail lost significantly more riders than Metrobus, according to an analysis of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) data.</p>

<p>This difference relates back to the idea of “captive” and “choice” riders. Washington is dominated by professional office workers, and these folks fall into the category of choice riders. As Pedersen explained, “Rail ridership in particular is dominated by central business district office workers. Bus has much more been serving essential workers, those who have to go to work for health care or other essential services where they clearly have to be on the job as opposed to being able to work from home.” Since the Metrorail is more popular among choice riders who can turn to alternative forms of transportation or perhaps work from home, Metrorail has lost the most riders. This holds true when comparing Metrobus and Metrorail ridership data from 2020 to that of 2019, too. Metrobus ridership decreased by an average of 62%, while Metrorail ridership decreased by an average of 84%.</p>

<p>WMATA is facing severe monetary loss as a result. Metrorail alone has lost nearly $500 million in 2020. Metro board released a <a href="https://www.wmata.com/about/board/meetings/board-pdfs/upload/3A-GM-FY2022-Proposed-Budget.pdf">proposal</a> on November 30th outlining the cutbacks they will have to make in 2021 if they don’t receive funding. The proposal would eliminate weekend Metrorail service entirely, close 19 stations, decrease rail service to every 30 minutes, and cut bus service by 45% of pre-pandemic levels. Eno Center for Transportation Policy Analyst Romic Aevaz said the proposed cutbacks would affect essential workers the most. “If transit agencies are still in a bad situation and they have to cut back service, it’s going to hurt the essential workers the most. Essential workers are the backbone of the economy, and their movement is critical.” Captive riders, many of which are essential workers, would have an even harder time getting around. Their movement is especially important during a pandemic when their help is needed most. Aevaz also pointed out the increased health risk with major cuts to rail services. “I think the overall thing is that the bus network is more widely used than the rail network for essential workers. It is going to be harmful because people will have to wait longer or have to take more crowded buses to work- that’s a health risk in and of itself.”</p>

<p>For many D.C. residents, the proposed service cuts would be a major inconvenience. But for some, these cuts would have far greater implications for their quality of life. TIME Reporter Researcher Alejandro de la Garza wrote a <a href="https://time.com/5869375/public-transit-coronavirus-covid/">piece</a> back in July on the effects of COVID-19 on public transit. I spoke with him about the impact of reduced transit service. “For people who are dependent on public transportation, when you reduce bus service that means there is a much greater chance that when the bus comes it is going to be full, and in the coronavirus pandemic you don’t want to be getting on super crowded buses to begin with,” Garza said. “That’s a whole other hour that you wait, and that’s not an inconvenience. That can really screw up your entire day. When you talk about the effects of those kinds on a person over a long period of time, that can really hurt someone’s quality of life.” If the proposal is to go into effect, we can expect further detriments for captive riders, especially essential workers, and a likely rise in COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>The future of Metro in D.C. and public transport nationwide is riding on federal assistance. The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) is <a href="https://apta.com/advocacy-legislation-policy/legislative-updates-alerts/updates/urge-members-of-congress-to-support-at-least-32-billion-of-additional-covid-19-emergency-funding-for-public-transit/">calling</a> on Congress to provide at least $32 billion in emergency funding for public transit. APTA President and CEO Paul Skoutelas <a href="https://apta.com/news-publications/press-releases/releases/statement-from-apta-president-and-ceo-paul-p-skoutelas-2/">said</a> that this funding will help public transit agencies to, “continue to provide essential services through the crisis and play an indispensable role in America’s economic recovery from COVID-19.” The funding would help offset revenue loss and prevent having to lay off large numbers of transit employees. Whether Congress will abide is another story. APTA issued their call for action in July, and the question still looms. “From the people I spoke to, especially the heads of these public transportation authorities, back in July or June, it was kind of inconceivable that they were not gonna get assistance, and then lo and behold we are in November and no assistance has come,” said Garza. The assistance is dependent on whether the Senate can reach a majority decision on a stimulus proposal. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/08/05/key-democrats-pledge-support-more-federal-aid-transit/">said</a> in a virtual news conference in August that, “27 Senate Republicans don’t want to spend one nickel on this. When you have a great transit crisis and economic crisis the public needs you to do it. Investing in mass transit now means that hard-working families can rely on the subway and bus to earn a living.” Congress is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2020/08/05/key-democrats-pledge-support-more-federal-aid-transit/">expected</a> to vote on a new relief proposal as early as next week which could abet D.C.’s public transit crisis or aggravate it. In the meantime, D.C. residents should prepare for an unrecognizable transit system in the coming year.</p>
