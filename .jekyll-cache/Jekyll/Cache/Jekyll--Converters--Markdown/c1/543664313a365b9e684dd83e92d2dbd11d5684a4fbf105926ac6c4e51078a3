I"µ<p>Angelina Floyd‚Äôs dream was to study Law in Washington D.C. Little did she know she would be paying for it for the next 10 years.</p>

<p>In the last 10 years, student debt has steadily increased. But as of 2019, the average student‚Äôs debt is over $25,000.</p>

<iframe title="Average Students Debt " aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-BmhwU" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BmhwU/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="304"></iframe>

<p>‚ÄúThe cost of my happiness and success is over $200,000 it‚Äôs scary,‚Äù said Floyd.</p>

<p>Floyd, an American University student, is currently studying justice and law and will owe over $40,000 just from undergraduate education.</p>

<p>She plans to continue her education by going to law school, her dream is to go to Georgetown Law. A University that will cost over $60,000 per year.</p>

<p>Despite the burden of the heavy debts, that will potentially take over 20 years to pay off, Floyd wants to continue her dream of becoming a lawyer.</p>

<h2 id="debts-lasting-effects">Debt‚Äôs Lasting Effects</h2>
<p>Cody Hounanian, project director at Student Debt Crisis explains the ‚Äúdomino effect‚Äù of student loans.</p>

<p>When graduates have so much debt it limits them from purchasing homes, starting a family, creating small businesses, and even starting credit cards.</p>

<p>The more debt you have the harder it is to start your own life.</p>

<p>High paying jobs such as a doctor require higher education which requires loans.</p>

<p>Floyd is an example of this. She will be in school until her late 20s raking up thousands of dollars in debt.</p>

<p>Floyd, however, is not worried about paying off her debts believing that once she starts in the workplace she will make a higher salary.</p>

<p>Despite this, the median salary of a student out of law school is $88,000. This means that Floyd could be paying off her debt for over 10 years.</p>

<p>Lawyers aren‚Äôt the only profession that requires higher levels of education. Hounanian said jobs like social workers, teachers, and healthcare workers all require master‚Äôs degrees or higher. These professions do not make enough to sustain these loans.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, these industries have also been hit the hardest.</p>

<p>Floyd is one of many students who dream of receiving higher education at prestigious universities.</p>

<p>Many students have to consider these factors now when applying to college.</p>

<h2 id="money-plays-a-factor-in-decided-on-college">Money Plays a Factor in Decided on College</h2>

<p>Eli Roegge, a High School student, has to think about these factors when applying to college.</p>

<p>Roegge‚Äôs dream is to attend college to study music composition at the University of California Berkley.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Roegge can not afford private school tuition forcing him to only apply to public schools in his home state of North Carolina.</p>

<p>Even attending a public university Roegge still anticipates taking out smaller loans to afford the tuition, that he expects will take him over five years to pay off fully.</p>

<p>Each year, more students make their higher education choices based on their economic needs.</p>

</script>

<p>These high tuition rates lead to other factors in our society. They perpetuate the racial and economic inequalities in the country.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBlack student loan borrowers have less wealth than their peers due to the compounded problem of the wage gap and student debt,‚Äù said Hounanian.</p>

<p>Women are also subjected to this because of the wage gap.</p>

<h2 id="whats-being-done">What‚Äôs Being Done</h2>

<p>Student Debt Crisis, SDC, is a grassroots advocacy organization that is looking to help end student debt.</p>

<p>SDC has recently switched there focus to help families that are struggling during the pandemic. This includes people who have decreasing working hours or have a job that puts them at an increased risk.</p>

<p>During COVID-19 the burden of student loans are even more taxing.</p>

<p>SDC has received over 1.4 million signatures on a petition to cancel student debt. Hounanian said that the only way to truly fix this problem is to cancel student debt and start making public universities free tuition.</p>

<p>Some things that help students suffering from mass student loan debt are policies such as federal loan refinancing and bankruptcy discharge. Student loan refinancing is receiving a lower interest rate compared to the one you are giving on your federal loans. A bankruptcy discharge is a court order that releases the debtor from paying their debts that are still owed.</p>

<p>SDC cosponsored the California Student Borrower Bill of Rights, which will be effective starting on January 1st. This aims to protect borrowers from loan services abuse that can cause student debt to grow.</p>

<p>This year is the first year that SDC has publicly supported a presidential nominee, president-elect Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Biden is being urged by SDC to go even further than his plan suggests by canceling all student loan debt.</p>

<p>Other politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer have acknowledged the major issue of student debt and are calling to help end the issue.</p>

<p>Warren, who ran for president in 2020, and Schumer had a plan laid out to cancel student loans that owed over $50,000, which is over 42 million people.</p>

<p>Biden‚Äôs plan is to cancel $10,000 of federal student loan debt as COVID-19 relief. This as Hounanian said is a step in the right direction.</p>

<p>Floyd is feeling more optimistic about her choice in degree after Biden became president-elect.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not as worried about undergraduate payments as I was before. I have less of a burden on me for pursuing more education,‚Äù Floyd said.</p>
