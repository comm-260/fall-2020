I"7*<p>The decriminalization and legalization of marijuana is a key issue for American voters. The most recent election saw major changes to marijuana laws in five states. In particular, young voters showed up in favor of legalization.</p>

<p>The 2020 election resulted in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota legalizing recreational marijuana. Earlier this year, Illinois was also added to that list. As of this year, marijuana is fully legal in 16 states, including the District of Columbia. Additionally, 42 states have either decriminalized marijuana, allow medicinal marijuana or both. In seven states, CBD oil is the only legal form.</p>

<p>This is still a relatively new process in the US, as the first states to legalize recreational marijuana, Colorado and Washington, only passed their laws in 2012. In less than a decade, more research has been done. Public opinion and discourse has also adapted in the last few years.</p>

<p>Young voters in particular have shown an upward trend in support. From 1994 to 2018, support for the legalization of marijuana amongst voters aged 18-34 has increased by almost 50%. To find recent data, Gallup released a poll “Americans’ Support for Legalizing Marijuana Among Demographic Groups,” however their age categories were slightly different than that of AP’s data. Nonetheless, as of 2020, we can assume around 77% of voters in that age category show their support.</p>

<p>In many states, citizens have to be 21 years or older to purchase marijuana, yet that did not stop eager voters aged 18-20 to vote in favor of these new laws. In an Instagram survey with 115 responses from college aged, 18-22 years old individuals, more than 93% said the federal government should decriminalize marijuana. This was a major difference from the amount of individuals who live in a state where that is the current law, just under 23%.</p>

<p>American University sophomore Joe Smieya voted in favor of recreational marijuana in New Jersey this past election. Although Smieya is only 19, he is excited to have the ability to legally use marijuana back home, once he is of age.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Smieya, and many others, understand the complexities of this issue and see it for more than an opportunity to get high. Smieya believes that these new laws are helpful, but not enough to end the stigma around marijuana.</p>

<p>“Decriminalization is not enough in a lot of ways. Marijuana still suffers from the inherent harms of prohibition. There is unequal advocacy of laws for certain groups of people. These unequal applications are typically against POC and it harms them more than anyone else,” said Smieya.</p>

<p>Racial injustice became increasingly discussed in 2020 after the George Floyd protests this summer. When it comes to the decriminalization of marijuana, one can look at the racial components of the war on drugs.</p>

<p>Atlas Klus, a 19-year-old American University student, also voted in favor of marijuana’s legalization in New Jersey. However, their focus was on protecting BIPOC rather than a personal desire to smoke.</p>

<p>“POC are prosecuted much more harshly and more often for marijuana related crimes and yet almost every young white boy I know smokes and they never get caught,” said Klus.</p>

<p>Making sure the legalization process is both beneficial and equitable has been a balancing act for Virginian legislatures. Their Governor Ralph Northam has made a commitment to legalizing recreational marijuana in 2021. For Illinois cannabis legalization expert Toi Hutchinson, it is of extreme importance that marijuana legalization not only uplift black communities through the legislation process, but through recognizing its social implications.</p>

<p>According to NBC 12, on Wednesday this week, Hutchinson joined the “Legalize It” virtual series run by the Tom Tom Foundation. There, she spoke more to addressing the issue of the criminalization of marijuana, particularly among young, black Virginians, and the implications of Governor Northam’s 2021 promise.</p>

<p>“It is one of the first ways, you get introduced, especially young African American boys between 18 and 24, introduced into the criminal justice system. And that has impacts for the rest of their lives for all of these families, for blocks and blocks of people,” said Hutchinson. “Equity in this space is about taking communities who have been harmed and giving them what they need to be in a position to be treated equally.”</p>

<p>The level of government involvement in this issue varies depending on who you ask. However, with public approval rising, as about two thirds of Americans support the legalization of marijuana, pressure is put on politicians to take action.</p>

<p>With the new Biden and Harris administration entering the white house, young voters expressed hope that they would be the team to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>In the same 115 person survey, around 56% believe that a Biden presidency will lead to the decriminalization of marijuana.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

<p>Although a majority of those surveyed expressed hope in the new administration, others shared fears and frustrations.</p>

<p>“They [Joe Biden and Kamala Harris] are a bunch of party democrats without a backbone between them,” said 21-year-old Ohioan Benjamin Mooney.</p>

<p>As far as what the public knows about their stances on the issue, Harris has been said to be in favor of legalizing marijuana while Biden has expressed a desire to leave it up to individual states.</p>

<p>“Although I would like to believe this administration will be progressive enough to legalize marijuana, Kamala’s past does not make me confident,” said 18-year-old University of South Carolina student Sophia Troutman.</p>

<p>Troutman is referring to Harris’ past as a prosecutor in California where she convicted a high number of residents. She also did not show support for the state’s push for legalization in 2016.</p>

<p>Although there are mixed opinions on the likelihood of major change in the next four years, public approval on the issue seems to be heading in a positive direction.</p>

<p>A new Gallup poll demonstrated a record high of 68% approval amongst Americans in regard to the legalization of marijuana.</p>

<p>Matthew Matos, a 22-year-old account coordinator for CGI health and New Jersey resident expressed that public approval will continue to go up as long as there is more conversation to end the stigma around marijuana.</p>

<p>“Of course If you’re relying on weed too much or using it to cope with anything it can be dangerous. However, I think more people need to look into its medical benefits,” said Matos.</p>

<p>Matos explained that many can overgeneralize the effects of marijuana as they remain ignorant to its complexities. It comes in different strands that give the body different effects that range from increased appetite, pain reduction, relieving anxiety, a feeling of euphoria or even arousal.</p>

<p>He walked through the process of the psychoactive component of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and how that is used to attach to endocannabinoids in one’s brain, and eventually cannabinoid receptors to give one’s body the feeling of being high.</p>

<p>“I think if you really want to end stigmas about it you have to let people know that although marijuana is a drug, all it is doing is activating something that is already existing in your body,” said Matos.</p>
