I"–+<p>When Jillian Farrel was 11 years old, her parents went through a tumultuous divorce that resulted in lifelong consequences for everyone 
involved. Her and her brothers were separated; Farrel lived with her 
mother, with her two brothers lived with their father. The causes of her  parents‚Äô separation varied from things as grand as unresolved trauma to tiny fights in the kitchen; nothing in her life was left untouched.</p>

<p>Now 17, Farrel is unable to clearly recall much of what happened during 
the year of the divorce, which was finalized in 2011, due to the memory 
loss that often results from trauma. However, she has been able to 
clearly articulate how this specific type of familial trauma has changed her as a person, making her into someone who is, at times, emotionally different from her peers.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI find that a lot harder to actually process my emotions; it‚Äôs easier to just isolate myself and deal with them on my own,‚Äù she said.</p>

<p>Avoidance also seems to come naturally: ‚ÄúIf I feel something, and I‚Äôm just not in a good place to feel it, I can put it away and completely ignore it until I‚Äôm somewhere else.</p>

<h2 id="the-differences-in-those-impacted-by-divorce">The Differences in those Impacted by Divorce</h2>

<p>In children with divorced parents, emotional maturity is hardly uncommon.</p>

<p>Divorce exposes kids to adult issues early on in their life, forcing them  to see the ugliest parts of strained parental relationships. Unfortunately, this causes their perspectives of right and wrong to be 
skewed; lack of exposure to healthy relationships has huge impacts on a 
child and the way that they relate to others for the rest of their 
lives.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt can be hard for me to tell whether or not a relationship or 
friendship is healthy,‚Äù  Farrel said.</p>

<p>The failure of a marriage between adults is often rooted in preexisting 
issues, some of the most prominent being: abuse and mental illness. 
Farrel‚Äôs mother, for example, was raised by a woman who got married six 
separate times, and was mentally abusive. This is a pattern that 
continued in the family; Farrel recounted years of the same type of abuse from her own mother.</p>

<p>Kristin Kuehner Ravo, a clinical social worker and therapist based in 
Long Valley, New Jersey, has worked extensively with teenage girls who 
have witnessed divorce. ‚Äú[Divorce] leads to all kinds of dysregulation, 
including addictions, self-esteem problems, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, and mood disorders. In general, I also see more promiscuity in teenage girls, anger, rebelliousness, and the taking on of too much 
responsibility,‚Äù Ravo said</p>

<p>Farrel made note of her own diagnosed mental illnesses, including 
Borderline Personality Disorder and Panic Attack Disorder. She also 
mentioned that she was forced to take on a lot of responsibilities at a 
young age. As a teenager, her mother was also put through this, from 
Farrel‚Äôs grandmother.</p>

<p>The ways in which parents treat their children is a cycle, just like 
divorce; children with divorced parents are far more likely to eventually get divorced themselves.</p>

<p>Divorce having a cyclical nature is something that is almost universally recognized. In a study done by the University of Utah, disruptions during childhood (such as a move, divorce, or death of a close family member) make it difficult for children to regulate their emotions and experiences. In turn, they are less likely to grow up to regulate their own relationships, often leading to instability with others.</p>

<p>However, it is also important to consider not only the people involved in these cycles, but also their demographic; did they grow up with money?</p>

<p>Did they themselves come from divorce and abuse? And, interestingly, 
where do they live</p>

<h2 id="divorce-a-cycle">Divorce: a cycle</h2>

<p>In New Jersey, where Farrel and her family live, the rate of divorce in 
2018 was about 12.7%. It is important to note that the rate of divorce 
varies slightly from county to county, where the population also varies</p>

<p>In data collected by Bowling Green State University, the divorce rate of each county in New Jersey was identified. Using data from the US Census, per capita was calculated:</p>

<iframe title="Divorce Rate 
per capita" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-j31pH" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/j31pH/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="787"></iframe>

<p>Farrel and her family live in Morris County, where the rate of divorce is not above average. However, her mother grew up in Sussex County, New 
Jersey, and her father was raised in Bergen County, New Jersey. The 
divorce rate per 1,000 people in Sussex County, where the population is 
sparse, is on the higher end, 4.16; in Bergen, which is densely 
populated, it is 3.18, far lower.</p>

<p>Although these regions are not more than an hour apart, where her parents grew up possibly had a great impact on why their marriage ended in failure.</p>

<h2 id="the-impact-of-location-and-substance-abuse">The Impact of Location and Substance Abuse</h2>

<p>Just like divorce, the rates of substance abuse also vary from county to county. 
In areas of New Jersey with comparatively more rural population 
demographics, there are also noticeably higher rates of substance abuse.</p>

<p>Substance abuse is a contributing factor to divorce, and is commonly more prevalent in rural areas than urban; therefore, it is not surprising that rates of divorce are often in rural areas than urban ones.</p>

<p>This is seen in Farrel‚Äôs family, and it is seen throughout New Jersey. 
This is due to a number of reasons, many of which connect with abuse. 
Farrel‚Äôs maternal grandmother, who got married six different times, had a period in her life during which she was addicted to hard substances. 
In data collected by The Department of Law and Public Safety of New 
Jersey, the abuse of hard drugs (such as cocaine, heroin, and morphine) 
is higher in states with a lower population demographic. Higher numbers 
of overdose per capita occur in the southernmost counties of New Jersey, which are more sparsely populated than the northern and central 
counties.</p>

<p>The Office of the Chief State Medical Examiner of the State of New Jersey kept track of all drug-related deaths in 2018:</p>

<iframe title="Rate of 
Overdoses on Hard Substances per capita 2018" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-IagkQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/IagkQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="797"></iframe>

<p>Bob Schirmer, a licensed clinical social worker, has worked with families in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania, and has seen the impacts of all types of abuse on relationships, families, and children 
‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen families where one of the parents was an addict and sexually 
abusive. The trauma that results from growing up in that type of 
environment often lasts someone‚Äôs whole life,‚Äù  he said. ‚ÄúThis might 
include becoming dependent on a substance themselves, during adulthood. 
Substance abuse creates enormous strains on a relationship, often leading to the termination of marriages; this is the way in which it contributes to the cycle of divorce.</p>

<h2 id="mental-illness">Mental Illness</h2>

<p>In addition to substance abuse, the effects of trauma and mental illness on a person can make it difficult to maintain relationships, especially if someone has childhood trauma resulting from witnessing their parents‚Äô marriage failing.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI have no desire at all to get married. I don‚Äôt want to end up like my 
mother,‚Äù  Farrel stated.</p>

<p>Schirmer also noted that he saw differences in kids who had divorced 
parents versus the other children he dealt with, in terms of 
vulnerability. ‚ÄúThe kids [whose parents had divorced] were always very 
cautious about what they shared with me,‚Äù  he said.</p>

<p>This connects back to the emotional differences between children with 
separated parents and those whose parents are still together; as seen in Farrel, emotions are often much easier to avoid.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA lot of it has to do with socioeconomic status as well as location. If you‚Äôre living in a poor area of the country and your family has no money, and your parents are working every day and aren‚Äôt home, problems ensue. You‚Äôre alone.‚Äù  Schirmer said.</p>

<p>‚ÄúPoor areas also have less mental health resources,‚Äù  he mentioned. As 
previously mentioned, they also have higher rates of substance abuse 
Schirmer has also worked with people who have MICA (Mental Illness 
Chemical Addiction), meaning that he has experience counseling people who are both mentally ill and addicted to substances, so it becomes unclear which behaviors are a result of mental illness and which are due to drug use. He said that this, in addition, contributes to a cycle of abuse, illness, and divorce.</p>

<p>Both of these are more prominent in the region of South Jersey, as 
compared to other regions with a higher population demographic 
In data collected by SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration) in a national survey from 2016-2018, the rates of 
substance abuse disorders and serious mental illness in each region of 
New Jersey were estimated, based on hypotheses and previously gathered 
population data</p>

<iframe title="Rates of Substance Abuse and Mental Illness in New Jersey 
Regions" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-wBICp" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wBICp/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="348"></iframe>

<p>Causing the cycle to perpetuate, it is difficult for people to make 
improvements on their life, that would allow them to maintain a stable 
marriage, in an area where resources (such as mental health services and rehab programs) are difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt always seems to get worse. It never just gets better. I don‚Äôt think 
I‚Äôve ever seen it get better,‚Äù  Schirmer said.</p>

<h2 id="moving-past-divorce">Moving past divorce</h2>

<p>Despite struggle, Farrel is confident that witnessing a divorce early on in her life has given her a unique level of maturity. ‚ÄúI think in terms of connecting with people [the divorce] has helped me. I‚Äôve been through distress and emotional trauma, which gives me the perspective to help people,‚Äù  she said. ‚ÄúMy parents put my brothers and I in a spot where we had to make some tough choices when we were pretty young. There wasn‚Äôt time to be a stupid child.‚Äù</p>

<p>Even in the most severe of circumstances, some kids are able to move past the trauma they have endured.</p>

<p>‚ÄúI think some kids are more resilient than others,‚Äù  Schirmer said. This connects to Farrel‚Äôs life, during which she has lived through this cycle and intends to put an end to it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúMy grandmother was abusive towards my mom, who was then abusive to me,‚Äù  she said. ‚ÄúAnd even though I‚Äôm grateful for the maturity my parents‚Äô split has brought, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll always have to live with. But I‚Äôm self-aware enough not to pass it on.</p>
