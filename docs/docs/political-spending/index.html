Since <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_Montana">1997</a>, no Democrat has won Montana’s congressional district at large. However, the 2017 special election to fill Montana’s vacant House seat was anything but ordinary.</p> <p>The day before the special election, Republican candidate Greg Gianforte body slammed a reporter, and audio of the incident was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/may/25/republican-greg-gianforte-body-slams-guardian-reporter-in-montana-video">posted online</a></p> <p>The backlash was swift. Gianforte was <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/05/25/ryan-pelosi-condemn-violence-montana-house-candidate-greg-gianforte/102143364/">condemned</a> by House leadership, he was charged with <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republican-greg-gianforte-wins-montana-special-election-body/story?id=47652910">assault</a> and ended up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/12/republican-greg-gianforte-sentenced-assaulting-guardian-reporter">pleading guilty</a>, but won the special election by eight points. However, most Montana voters had already cast their ballots before the assault scandal broke, and some political pundits believed Gianforte would be <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/index.php/analysis/house/house-overview/house-ratings-changes-10-districts-move-mostly-democrats-direction">vulnerable</a>in the 2018 midterms. Gianforte was not.</p> <p>Gianforte <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/07/gop-rep-greg-gianforte-wins-re-election-in-montana-nbc-news.html">won again</a> in 2018, and in 2021 Gianforte will become the <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/524417-gop-rep-greg-gianforte-wins-montana-governors-race">governor</a> of the Treasure State after winning the 2020 gubernatorial race. It might be surprising to some why a man convicted of a crime keeps winning elections, but Gianforte’s win isn’t so shocking from a financial perspective.</p> <p>Specifically, the 2018 midterm election where Gianforte faced democratic challenger Kathleen Williams. In that race Gianforte spent nearly ten million dollars compared to Williams’s near four million dollars, Gianforte spent two times what Williams did, and Gianforte spent nearly one point two million dollars per 100,000 eligible voters. For one expert, outspending your opponent can make the difference between victory and defeat.</p> <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4618242/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe> <div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4618242/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4618242" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /> </a></div> <p>Molly <a href="https://www.american.edu/soc/faculty/morourke.cfm">O’Rourke</a> is a professor at American University, and she has studied political races for years. While spending money has less of an impact on a senate or presidential election, O’Rourke, said that election spending is critical for House races.</p> <p>“In a House race it is still a pretty significant factor how much money you spend,” O’Rourke said. “The reason that it (spending in House races) distinguishes it from a senate, or a presidential race is that in a House race even a well-known incumbent has name id under 50 percent.”</p> <p>O’Rourke said that the specifics of the race or a major scandal (such as body slamming a reporter for asking a question and breaking their <a href="https://twitter.com/bencjacobs/status/867517225820966912?lang=en">glasses</a> could negate the importance of spending. However, O’Rourke said that House candidates who spend the most usually win, and that was what Gianforte did.</p> <p>However, winning candidates must meet certain spending thresholds in order to win house races.</p> <p>Using data from the nonprofit research group <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/winning-vs-spending?cycle=2018">Open Secrets</a> on the 2018 election (2020 results are not officially <a href="https://history.house.gov/Institution/Election-Statistics/">recognized</a> by the federal government yet) prospective candidates for the US House of Representatives can plot a path to electoral victory.</p> <p>On average, winning candidates spent a little more than two million dollars and winning candidates outspent their opponents 54 to 1. Winning candidates usually spent an average of about four dollars per person in their <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/voting-and-registration/congressional-voting-tables.html">district</a>, and winning candidates spent on average about four hundred thousand dollars per 100,000 eligible voters in their district.</p> <p>Gianforte didn’t outspend Kathleen Williams 54 to 1, but he matched every other benchmark for a winning candidate. From a spending perspective, Gianforte’s win was never in doubt.</p> <p>Of course, there were outliers. Democratic candidate David Trone spent more than 18 million dollars to win Maryland’s sixth district, the most spent by a winning candidate. The least a winner spent in the cycle was Democratic candidate Jose Serrano only spent 230,000 dollars to win the 15th district of New York.</p> <iframe title="How Much Did Your House Rep Spend To Win Their Seat In The 2018 Midterm " aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-bZcLx" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/bZcLx/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="536"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}(); </script> <p>California candidates spent 180 million dollars total on House races, the highest in the country, whereas the lowest amount of money spent was Vermont at nearly seven million dollars. Indeed states with bigger populations spent significant amounts of money.</p> <p>The five states that spent the most money on House races were California, Texas, New York, Florida, and Pennsylvania, the five states with the <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-state-total.html">highest populations</a> in 2018, and collectively they spent half a billion dollars. Interestingly, spending patterns of winning candidates in these states essentially fell in line with the country wide averages.</p> <p>In total, the five biggest states made up 39 percent of total spending on congressional races in 2018. The amount of money might seem surprising, but what is not shocking is that spending on elections has only gone up in recent in years. The question now is how candidates raise so much money.</p> <p>The first answer is direct donations. Candidates can receive donations from individual donors, the political party they affiliate with, and many other ways. However, direct donations are <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/what-is-a-pac">capped</a>. The majority of money spent on elections come from indirect sources like a Super Political Action Committees.</p> <p>Super PACs are groups that can take in money from donors, from corporate interests, from unions, and other PACs without limit. They can spend unlimited amounts of money on campaign related endeavors, but Super PACs must do so independently of any candidate, campaign, or political party. However, some experts argue that Super PACs are not hindered by rules of independence. Candice Nelson is one of them.</p> <p>Nelson is an American University professor in the Department of Government, and she is an expert in political communication and campaign finance. Nelson said that Super PACS and parties have a simple work around for the little regulation they face called signaling.</p> <p>“If a candidate puts on his or her website these are the three most important issue this election, that’s public information,” Nelson said. “Both the campaign side and the Super Pac side have gotten better at reading each other’s signals.”</p> <p>While Nelson said that Super PACS generally ignore house races and focus on senate and presidential races, they play crucial role in the current system that is only getting bigger.</p> <p>The 2018 midterm election was the most <a href="link: https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2019/02/cost-of-2018-election-5pnt7bil/">expensive</a> U.S midterm election in history, and nearly six billion dollars were spent in total. Spending increased 49 percent compared to the 2014 midterm <a href="link: https://www.opensecrets.org/elections-overview/cost-of-election?cycle=2020&amp;display=T&amp;infl=N">elections</a>. However, it isn’t just candidates that are spending money on elections.</p> <p>Both political <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/parties/index.php?cmte=&amp;cycle=2020">parties</a> spent nearly two billion dollars in the 2018 midterms, and overall party spending has gone up 18 percent since 2000. American elections have turned into big business in the 21st century, and candidates running for office have two Supreme Court cases to thank for that.</p> <iframe src="https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/4509093/embed" title="Interactive or visual content" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="width:100%;height:600px;"></iframe> <div style="width:100%!;margin-top:4px!important;text-align:right!important;"><a class="flourish-credit" href="https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/4509093/?utm_source=embed&amp;utm_campaign=visualisation/4509093" target="_top" style="text-decoration:none!important"><img alt="Made with Flourish" src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/made_with_flourish.svg" style="width:105px!important;height:16px!important;border:none!important;margin:0!important;" /> </a></div> <p>. )</p> <p>The first <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1975/75-436">case</a> was <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em> in 1976 and the second <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2008/08-205">case</a> was <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> in 2010. In <em>Buckley v. Valeo</em>, the court ruled that the federal government could restrict individual donations to candidates and campaigns. However, the ruling presented a loophole.</p> <p>The court also ruled that the government could not limit total spending of a campaign or candidate because doing so would violate the First Amendment right of freedom of speech. With the distinction, the 1976 case would pave the way for the second case.</p> <p>In <em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em>, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not ban corporate interests from contributing to political efforts.</p> <p>The court argued that corporate funding could not be restricted, and that doing so infringed upon the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment. The ruling removed previous <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/08/the-legacy-of-mccain-feingold/">regulation</a> that had prohibited such spending and allowed for the creation of Super PACS.</p> <p><em>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</em> and the subsequent cases that proceeded opened the flood gates for election spending. However, some argue that the current status quo is bad for America.</p> <p>For experts like O’Rourke, the amount money required to win a seat in the House is a problem.</p> <p>“It serves as a barrier to people who want to run,” she said. “People who are considering challenging somebody they know can outspend, it serves as a big disincentive.”</p> <p>O’Rourke also said that the amount of time required to raise money limits the pool of potential candidates.</p> <p>“This how much money you’re going to need to raise to be competitive in this district. That means you’re going to have to spend an hour, two hours, three hours every day of this campaign raising money, and people will just look at you and I say that I don’t want to do that.”</p> <p>O’Rourke is not alone in her worry. Former United States Secretary of the Army <a href="https://www.wcl.american.edu/community/faculty/profile/caldera/bio/">Louis Caldera</a> agrees with O’Rourke. Caldera is now a professor at the Washington College of Law, and Caldera is an expert in election law.</p> <p>To Caldera, the presence of money in politics has a corrosive effect.</p> <p>“Legislators will conform their behavior to what they believe what is necessary to attract large contributions, and they’ll be corrupted,” Caldera said. “Even if they’re not taking a bribe per say, their policy choices and willingness to buck the desires of special interest is constraint because they’ll pay a price.”</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2020/student-debt/">&laquo; Student Debt is Worse Than Ever Before</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2020/car-crashes-planning/">Proper Management of City Planning Lends to a Reduced Number of Crashes &raquo;</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="col-md-4 mt20"> <div class="post-img"> <img width="600" src="/fall-2020/images/gettyimages-688504932_wide-3d645389c8d18d6ee4a8bc6053a89cec24a22a63.jpg" alt="A Politician’s Guide to Getting Elected to the US House of Representatives"> </div> <div class="mt10 recent"> <h2>Recent articles</h2> <ul> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2020/resaurant-inspections-yelp/">Yelp ratings don’t reflect inspection grades, and restaurant owners aren’t happy</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Dec 2020</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2020/metro-ridership-covid/">Why DC Metrorail has been hit the hardest by the pandemic, and what its future is riding on</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Dec 2020</small></p> </li> <li> <p><a href="/fall-2020/immigration/">Mexico, India, China are Leading Sources of Legal Immigration to the U.S.</a><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;12 Dec 2020</small></p> </li> </ul> </div> <!-- <div class="mt10"> <div class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" data-width="400" data-small-header="true" data-adapt-container-width="true" data-hide-cover="true" data-show-facepile="true"><blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/" class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/webjeda/">webjeda</a></blockquote></div> </div> <br> --> </div> </div> <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.6&appId=549480635219583"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script> </div> </div> <footer> <div class="container"> <div class="row p20"> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25">All rights reserved by <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.webjeda.com">webjeda</a></div> --> <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25" > <a target="_blank" href="http://webjeda.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20by-webjeda-blue.svg" alt="webjeda"></a> </div> <!-- <div class="col-md-4 text-center mt25"> <a target="_blank" href="http://facebook.com/webjeda"><li class="social facebook"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://quora.com/sharathdt"><li class="social quora"><i class="fa fa-quora"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/@webjeda"><li class="social twitter"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="http://github.com/webjeda"><li class="social github"><i class="fa fa-github-square"></i></li></a> <a target="_blank" href="mailto:hello@webjeda.com"><li class="social email"><i class="fa fa-envelope"></i></li></a> </div> --> </div> </div> </footer> <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.2/jquery.min.js"></script> <script src="/fall-2020/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script> <!-- Google Analytics Tracking code --> <script> (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){ (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o), m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m) })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'); ga('create', 'UA-83979019-1', 'auto'); ga('send', 'pageview'); </script> </body> </html>
