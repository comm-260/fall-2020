Of the 92 counties in the state of Indiana, Monroe was ranked <a href="https://www.in.gov/cji/research/files/2014_IN_CrashFactBook_Web.pdf">12th</a> for total collisions. Home to 150,000 residents, Monroe is also the <a href="https://www.indiana-demographics.com/counties_by_population">12th largest county</a> in Indiana.</p> <p>Every year in Monroe, <a href="https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/traffic-data">4,200 crashes</a> occurred, resulting in fatal injuries, incapacitating injuries, non-incapacitating injuries, and no injuries. These crashes were tracked by the City of Bloomington’s Department of Planning and Transportation (DPT). The information recorded by the DPT includes the date, collision type, injury type, primary factor, and location (including longitude and latitude).</p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4551856"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>The collision types included 1-car, 2-car, 3+ cars, bus, cyclist, moped/motorcycle and pedestrians. 17% of moped/motorcycle crashes resulted in fatal or incapacitating injuries. Similarly, 18% of crashes involving a pedestrian were fatal or incapacitating. Only 2% of 1-car crashes resulted in fatal or incapacitating injuries.</p> <p>As predicted, most crashes occurred between 3 pm and 5 pm. Approximately three crashes occurred every day in Monroe County during this time. Weekdays also produced more accidents than weekends. This is most likely due to rush hour when more people are on the road picking children up from school or returning home at the end of the workday. By contrast, from 12 am-6 am, one crash happened every four days.</p> <p>An analysis of the data shows that most crashes were caused by failure to yield to the right of way. Other notable offenses were running off the road toward the right shoulder, unsafe backing, and following too closely. These factors explained why most crashes occurred between two cars, accounting for 70% of the total crashes. The year with the highest number of accidents was 2003, with the highest month being December. This is potentially due to the presence of snow.</p> <iframe title="Crash Primary Factor (2003-2015)" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-iev97" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/iev97/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="1424"></iframe> <p>Monroe County also reported on data from <a href="https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/traffic-data">2013-2018</a>. Since the other dataset included crash data for 2013-2015, I shortened this dataset to only include 2016-2018. Grave shifts in the crash patterns were visible between the two datasets. Rush hour was still the most popular crash time, but October has had the most crashes. The most common collision types were rear-ending, running off the road, and right-angle crashes. The primary factors were traffic controls, lane control, and traffic control signal.</p> <iframe title="Crash Primary Factor (2016-2018)" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Jfh9I" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Jfh9I/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="624"></iframe> <p>There were two notable shifts between the datasets. The dataset from 2003-2015 showed that most crashes occurred in downtown Bloomington (S Walnut Street, 3rd Street, N College Ave, W Kirkwood Avenue, etc.). In the 2013-2018 dataset, most crashes occurred on major state routes (I-69, SR 37, and SR45/46). The other shift was an overall decrease in the number of crashes.</p> <p>Analyzing both sets of data produced very different sets of information, which means there are two logical explanations: errors in “raw” data or major transformations to the area. Patrick Martin, the Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization Transportation Planner, says it is a combination of these two factors that have caused many of the shifts in the data.</p> <p>Raw data, because it is primary data, can often contain errors. “Crash reports are subject to errors with regard to precise locations. Sometimes crash locations are as much as 300 feet from an assigned intersection,” says Martin. Raw data may be the cause of the difference in number of crashes in overlapping years.</p> <p>Even though there are different numbers of crashes for 2013, 2014, and 2015, both datasets prove a decrease in overall crashes and a shift in location. Patrick Martin says that the reason for this is because the city has “a focus on safety, through land use development policies, and focus on multi-modal transportation by the city, the county, and INDOT [Indiana Department of Transportation].”</p> <p>Since 2003, Monroe County has undergone construction to improve downtown Bloomington and I-69, SR 45/46, and SR 37. The county tracked crash locations and changes in the data to determine where to make modifications.</p> <p>Martin explained that SR 37 was converted to I-69, which led to “a higher-than-normal level of crashes and fatal crashes.” Furthermore, Martin states, “The conversion of the SR37 corridor into I-69 in recent years additionally altered travel patterns, changed land uses and convinced the city council into adoption of a compact urban form of development.”</p> <p>Due to the conversion, the Bloomington/Monroe County Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) wanted to shift traffic away from the SR37/I-69 corridor to SR45, SR46, SR45/46, and SR48. Downtown Bloomington, near the 3rd Street/Whitehall Pike corridor, also saw several improvements such as doubling lanes and adding a median. Additionally, many of the at-grade intersections were eliminated. SR 45/46 corridor also underwent major construction: doubling the number of lanes as well as accompanying sheltered turn lanes.</p> <p>The SR 37 conversion and redistribution led to many mixed-use developments due to employment location shifts and the need for housing in downtown Bloomington. Often, the ground level contains shops that are targeted at Indiana University Bloomington and Ivy Tech Community College Bloomington students, with housing built above the shops.</p> <p>Since Bloomington is a college town, Monroe County focused on taking measures to protect cyclists and pedestrians. When Bloomington Transit partnered with the IU Campus Bus, it created a marked increase in the number of bus riders. Patrick Martin explained that this partnership was not only beneficial to the people but also made traffic cost-effective and more efficient.</p> <p>The 2003-2015 data and the 2013-2018 data do not factor in other critical variables in the crash statistics. Impatience was a factor that was not discussed in the data but would be difficult to analyze. With the onslaught of construction and changes to traffic patterns, drivers and motorists were experiencing construction fatigue. Additionally, personal cell phones have been a large contributor to many crashes (i.e., texting and driving). When it comes to crashes, driver behavior is very difficult to measure.</p> <p>As Martin mentioned, Monroe County has undergone many projects to improve the roads for its constituents. Downtown Bloomington has continually made <a href="https://bloomington.in.gov/sites/default/files/2017-05/TIP_2010-2013.pdf">improvements</a> for vehicles such as pavement preservations or markings, signal upgrades (i.e., traffic signal modernizations), general maintenance, and traffic signal modifications. Monroe County also continually works to improve the infrastructure of highways as well. Some of the new projects include drainage improvements, right of way acquisition, and paving projects.</p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4628167"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>The bar graph above highlights the overall decline in number of crashes in Monroe County. Looking solely at 2-car crashes, the number decreases by almost 500. It’s also interesting to note how bus, cyclist, moped/motorcycle, and pedestrian numbers are inconsistent each year.</p> <p>Due to all of this change, INDOT is better managing the effectiveness of projects like “additional multi-use bicycle/pedestrian pathways, the replacement of pedestrian ramps, improvements to transit stops &amp; route reorientation, the initiation of micro-transit, micro-mobility (scooters), signal timings, and a multitude of other transportation urban planning/transportation engineering approaches,” says Martin.</p> <p>In November, the city implemented its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=801053337124175&amp;ref=watch_permalink">first sheltered bike lane</a> to protect cyclists. Facebook Live streamed the ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new bike lane, and many Facebook users were excited about the new improvements to the city. At the ceremony, Bloomington Mayor John Hamilton said, “Since 2016É built or replaced 29 miles of bike pathsÉ including 12 miles of sidewalks, 10 miles of bike lanes, and 7 miles of multi-use paths.”</p> <p>After analyzing the data from the <a href="https://data.bloomington.in.gov/dataset/traffic-data">2019 dataset</a>, it is evident Monroe County has made significant improvements. In 2019, the first mention of a state route or interstate is I-69, the 19th most popular crash site. Additionally, 2019 had a lower number of crashes than the other datasets, highlighting the improvements that Monroe County has made to their roadways, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and multi-use paths.</p> <p>“As I’ve traveled to Bloomington, I’ve seen a lot of construction going on there. There were some major projects happening a few years back. It’s nice to see improvements that keep me and others safe on the road,” said Alec, a resident of Indianapolis.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2020/political-spending/">&laquo; A Politician’s Guide to Getting Elected to the US House of Representatives</a></li> <li><a class="previous" href="/fall-2020/north-korean-defectors/">North Koreans' fight for freedom sees a drop over the past decade.
