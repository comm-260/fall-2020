With so many drastic changes this year, people across the country have struggled to keep up, causing stress and affecting our mental health. Other countries such as New Zealand and the British Virgin Islands have either few to no Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>Although these countries are significantly smaller making it less likely for the virus to spread, their leaders immediately took charge and enforced safety measures. Unlike these countries, The United States now ranks number one for the most Covid-19 cases and it’s gradually increasing at a high rate.</p> <p>It’s now the month of December and many have questioned, when will we ever get back to some form of normalcy? Covid-19 cases aren’t the only thing that have been rising this past year.</p> <p>According to a study and data set provided by the Gun Violence Archive, gun violence has increased by 283.42% between the years of 2018 and 2019. Since 2018, gun violence has increased causing concern for people across the country.</p> <p>Gun violence in America is pretty prominent compared to other countries in the world. The United States is currently ranked number two for the second-highest amount of gun deaths in the world (37,200). In the year 2020 alone, the United States had 12.21 firearm-related deaths rate per 100,000. Compared to the rest of the world, guns are more commonly used in the United States.</p> <p>It may come to one as a surprise but, more weapons were purchased due to Covid-19 than any other reason during the year of 2020. Due to the uncertainty of Covid-19, millions of Americans bought new firearms during the middle of the global pandemic as a way to ensure safety for their families.</p> <p>Although many Americans believed this was a necessary purchase, what many didn’t realize is that they were exposing their families to higher risks of suicide, homicide, unintentional shootings, and intimate partner violence.</p> <p>Since the peak of the Coronavirus outbreak in March, gun deaths have trended higher than the same time last year. Since the demand of guns surged during the pandemic, it’s resulted in about 2.6 million additional gun sales.</p> <p>According to FBI data, March of 2020 set an all-time record for the highest number of National Instant Criminal Background Check System background checks requested since the system was created 20 years ago. To put that into perspective, only 7.3 million requests were received during the same time last year in 2019. From about March to May of 2020, almost six million guns were sold.</p> <iframe title="Background Checks in the United States" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-lwIle" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/lwIle/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="400"></iframe> <p>Although some people may argue that guns can be used as a form of self-defense, every year people who should have been denied a gun or weapon, slip through the cracks.</p> <p>By federal law, a licensed gun dealer is required to run a background check on each person he or she sells a gun to. However, there are loopholes to this system. Every year, thousands of people who aren’t actually qualified to own a weapon find a way to obtain one. As a result, the United States has hundreds of thousands mass shootings per year.</p> <p>To make matters worse, they have happened in some of the most random and unpredictable places. There have been shootings in movie theaters, concerts, clubs, and even schools.</p> <p>On December 14, 2012, Jackson Mittleman was sitting in orchestra class at the intermediate school down the street from Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut. When the school announced there’d be a lockdown, many of the other sixth graders in his class just assumed it was a standard lockdown, like the ones they had been practicing since lower school. What they’d find out a couple hours later, would change Mittleman’s life forever.</p> <p>That day 28 people, including students and staff, were killed by shooter, Adam Lanza at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It was a tragedy that left many people confused, sorrowful, and startled.</p> <p>Since then, Mittlemen has become an advocate for the prevention of gun violence in America. He first got involved when a friend invited him to an event his mom was hosting called the Newtown Action Alliance. From the time he was in seventh grade, he attended as many of their events as he could and had the opportunity of meeting members of congress along the way. The day before the March For Our Lives walk in Washington DC, Mittlemen was asked to speak on the behalf of his town and the Newtown Action Alliance.</p> <p>“The shooting changed my entire life. It changed my course in regard to the career I wanted to pursue. It allowed me to find a passion in politics and advocacy. It’s the reason I go to school in DC and do what I do. But it also made me realize that when there’s an issue that’s affecting you or affecting everyone, you should use your voice to speak out about it because stories and faces and individual people make movements. That’s how change is made” stated Mittlemen when asked about the impact this event left him.</p> <iframe title="December and November 2020 Deaths and Injuries due to Gun Violence" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-dvZL7" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/dvZL7/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="509"></iframe> <p>Due to many mass shootings such as the Sandy Hook shooting, people both young and old have taken part to try and prevent more from occurring. Ishita Jamar was both stunned and confused after hearing about the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Shooting in Parkland Florida on Valentine’s Day of 2018. Being from New Jersey, Jamar had no ties to the Parkland shooting, but she still felt some sort of connection to those students.</p> <p>“I didn’t know how to take it in. I was confused and didn’t know how to dealt with the situation. It wasn’t until the day after when I started reading about the people and seeing the victim’s names being broadcasted all over the news that it really hit me. It brought me a lot of different emotions. I was in high school at the time. I just kept thinking these people went to high school one day and were never able to come back home to their families.”</p> <p>After the Parkland shooting Jamar got involved with an organization called Students Demand Action. Since she was junior class president at the time and an advocate for many other organizations, she was given the opportunity to speak about the Parkland Shooting at her town’s walkout.</p> <p>“I became passionate about something I didn’t realize was an issue. That made an impact in my life because I started talking and teaching people about gun violence and the affect it has on communities. Through this, I learned that I could make a difference. I’ve been to so many summits and have learned to fight for the things you want to change.”</p> <p>If gun violence is such a big issue, then why haven’t gun laws been changed? A statistic provided by the Pew Research Center stated that three-in-ten American adults say they own a gun and an additional 11 percent say they live with someone who does.</p> <p>Whether one knows someone who personally owns a gun or not, about half of U.S. adults grew up in a household with guns. Americans have more exposure to firearms than most people living in the world. The main reason for owning a weapon in the United States is for protection (67%), while others say they use guns for hunting, sport shooting, gun collecting, or their job.</p> <p>Alex Meriano has been an FBI agent for about 25 years. As an agent he’s seen a lot of crime and violence, but believes the American people have every right to bear arms.</p> <p>When asked if he thought eliminating the second amendment would decrease the amount of mass shootings he said, “You can’t punish the entire country for the actions of one person. I’ve seen a lot of crime. In my experience most of the weapons I’ve seen were illegally obtained. They were either stolen or purchased through the black market. I think we need to be able to protect ourselves. When the government takes away your weapons, you have no recourse. I do believe we should have more gun restrictions but, doing away with the second amendment won’t solve the problem.”</p> <p>Gun violence in the United States isn’t something that will get better overnight. Based off the data and statistics, one could infer that it’s progressively getting worse. Politics play a huge role in making change and with time, hopefully the right person will impact communities positively.</p> <p>As it may come to one’s surprise, the global pandemic worsened gun violence and the United States now holds a record for the most recorded background checks in the last 20 years. As the pandemic continues and the new president elect, Joe Biden, transitions into office hopefully the United States will get a hold of gun violence in America and prevent more shootings from occurring.</p> <iframe title="2016 Fatalities due to Gun Violence" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-aSBqQ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/aSBqQ/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="502"></iframe> <iframe title="2019 Fatalities due to Gun Violence" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-cWD05" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/cWD05/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="600" height="511"></iframe> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = '//webjeda-demo.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript> --> </div> <div class="row"> <ul class="pager"> <li><a class="next" href="/fall-2020/north-korean-defectors/">&laquo; North Koreans' fight for freedom sees a drop over the past decade.
