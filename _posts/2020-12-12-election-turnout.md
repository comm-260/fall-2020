In most American elections, between 35 and 60 percent of eligible voters will not cast a ballot, however, this year's turnout broke a nearly century long record. More Americans voted in the 2020 presidential election than any other election in 120 years. Even amidst a   consequential pandemic, approximately 159 million people voted according to the [United States Election Project](http://www.electproject.org/), a turnout-tracking database run by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.

Despite American elections having a tendency for low turnout, this year was already anticipated to have high numbers of people showing up to the polls. Data Reporter for FiveThirtyEight, Nathaniel Rakich notes that the 2018 midterm elections were a key indicator of a change brewing in the American voter base.

"In the 2018 House [of Representatives] and Senate elections, there was a huge turnout that normally you don't see in non-presidential elections," Rakich said. "I do think 2020 was on pace to having a high turnout ever since Donald Trump's election. There was a lot of energy from the Democrat party to get out the vote, and they were able to flip the House as a result." In fact, according to the United States Election Project, 50 % of the voting eligible population voted in the 2018 midterm elections, the highest turnout since 1914. 

With much anticipation for this presidential election, there were a lot of factors that could have contributed to this high turnout. As noted by Rakich, Donald Trump's presidency increased political activism amongst Americans, especially those who typically vote Democrat. However, within the last year of Trump's term, the American public has had to endure a fatal and economically damaging pandemic.

Additionally, the infamous police killing of George Floyd led to a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement across the nation. This rendered unique circumstances to this election, with tensions high over racial injustice and COVID-19 frustrations. Not only was the 2020 political climate vastly different from election years prior, but the pandemic also caused the election to be conducted in an unusual manner so as to maintain social distancing and safety measures. Furthermore, COVID-19 had ranging effects on voters throughout the election, originally sparking concerns about voter turnout. 

A data report from the [Center for Election Innovation and Research](https://electioninnovation.org/new-voter-registrations-in-2020/) tracked voter registration trends in eleven states and the District of Columbia, finding that the pandemic had damaging effects on registering new voters. Initially, looking at voter registration data in the first months of the pandemic, there was a large drop in new registrations comparatively to 2016.

During the first months of the pandemic, there was lots of job loss, city-wide closures, and efforts to stop the spread of the virus. This vast societal change could have had something to do with low registration numbers. However, in many of these states, in the months following George Floyd's death and the Black Lives Matter movement, there was a stark increase in voter registrations.

Bill Dalbec, the managing director of APCO Worldwide, an independent public affairs and research agency, worked with polling data for the 2020 election and found that these numbers were significant.

"I think a couple factors contribute to the high turnout we saw in 2020, but the aftermath of George Floyd's death and others over the summer really started a serious conversation about social and racial inequity," Dalbec said. "People were really motivated to vote or to at least be politically active after Black Lives Matter protests and we can even see a change in our political climate afterwards." As voter registration progressively increased after June and July, indicating the Black Lives Matter movement's influence on voter turnout, efforts amongst states to allow for early voting or vote by mail began. Rakich believes that the pandemic, originally thought to thwart turnout, may have actually helped it.

"The pandemic clearly wasn't fatal to the turnout this year, even though there was uncertainty about navigating this election through COVID-19," Rakich stated, citing concerns about accessibility to vote. "Kind of paradoxically, by forcing many states to switch to vote by mail, which has historically increased voter turnout, you could say that pandemic increased turnout. At the very least, we can be confident that it didn't have a significant dampening effect." 

In fact, the United States Election Project reports that there were about 100 million early ballots, 65 million of which were mail-in ballots. It is likely that more people voted by mail because of concerns about contracting the COVID-19 virus and especially because more states allowed for no excuse absentee voting.

"Because of the pandemic, states made it easier to request mail-in ballots.  There were 5 states that still required voters to provide an excuse to vote absentee ballots, but 45 states let people vote by mail if they wanted to. In normal elections, only 34 states plus Washington DC allow for no excuse absentee voting," Rakich stated. 

Thalia Tossetti, first time voter and mail-in ballot voter from New York also believes that the pandemic made voting easier for her. 

"This election more people are probably voting, because for me, in New York, it's easier to request and mail absentee ballots and I know you can also vote early," Tossetti said. "Honestly, COVID-19 made it more accessible to vote. I wanted to vote absentee because I wouldn't be home for the election, but in my state, you didn't even need an excuse to vote by mail."

While America has had turnout rise and fall throughout history, this election comes at time with unprecedented conditions. With the pandemic's abysmal effect on the economy, Donald Trump's presidency inspiring many left-leaning voters to show up to the polls, as well as the impassioned energy surrounding the Black Lives Matter movement, the American environment was ripe for change. Yet, because of the uniqueness of this election, these voter trends may not continue. 

"If I had to guess, I would say this election is an anomaly," Rakich said conclusively. "Overall 2024 might look more like 2016. That said, every new trend starts with one data point, and maybe this will be the start of a high voter turnout trend."
