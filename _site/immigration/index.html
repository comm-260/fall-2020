With a yearly average of 155,271 immigrants from Mexico, 64,417 from China and 60,327 from India for the past 21 years, these numbers are slowly changing the racial and ethnic makeup of the United States. </p> <p><strong>Immigrant Count Breakdown Per Year</strong></p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4545739"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4545792"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4545807"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>“While Hispanics are still the largest racial and ethnic minority group, there has been a growing presence of Asian-born immigrants also coming to the United States,” said Gitika Harith, a research intern at MPI. “This research helps us gauge where immigration is most prevalent and understand trends as to why that is - specifically for the top three countries of Mexico, China and India.”</p> <p>There are various <a href="https://oxfordre.com/americanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-146">push and pull factors</a> that determine why a Mexican citizen would choose to immigrate to the U.S. The history of Mexican immigration to the U.S. is best characterized as the movement of unskilled, manual laborers <em>pushed</em> northward mostly by poverty and <em>pulled</em> into American labor markets with higher wages. Historically, most Mexicans have been economic immigrants seeking to improve their lives, although many still work in primarily low-skilled jobs. Even amidst four presidencies, coupled with their cabinet’s respective immigration policy priorities and restrictions, Mexico has remained the highest country of origin for immigrants every year for nearly two decades.</p> <p>The MPI research also contains information regarding citizenship rates from these nations from 1999 to 2019. Coincidentally, the same nations occupy the highest rates of obtained citizenship. Data shows that out of all immigrants seeking citizenship, Mexico dominates the charts with nearly 2.4 million naturalized citizens.  </p> <iframe title="Annual Naturalization Citizenship Count 1999-2019" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-b9U2r" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/b9U2r/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="978"></iframe> <script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</script> <p>“Many Mexican immigrants come to the U.S. so that they can provide a better future for their children, even if they themselves would have rather stayed in Mexico,” said Amy Fisher, legislative assistant overseeing immigration affairs in the office of Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (WA-07). “We have seen a clear attack from the Trump administration on Mexican immigrants in particular, but the reality is Mexican immigrants actually make up the bulk of our <em>legal</em> immigrants, many of which later go on to pursue the arduous and costly naturalization process.” </p> <p><strong>Mexican Naturalization Rates Per Year</strong></p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4545973"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>According to MPI, Mexican immigrants occupy the <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/asian-immigrants-united-states-2014">greatest number of B-1 and B-2 visas</a>, which are far easier to acquire than HB1s or green cards. These visas (B-1 or B-2) are primarily given to supply the kinds of low-wage jobs that many immigrants from Mexico and other Latin American countries are employed with. </p> <p>Conversely, the high levels of Asian immigrants are primarily attributed to their employment in high-skilled jobs and pursuit of higher education. Immigration from Asia to the United States <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/asian-immigrants-united-states-2014">rose dramatically with passage of the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act</a>, which removed the 1921 national-origin quotas restricting immigration from Asian and Arab countries and sharply limiting arrivals from Africa, eastern and southern Europe. The Act also prioritized highly educated and skilled workers arriving on H-1B visas. Since then, Asian Americans have comprised a large segment of the United States immigration population.</p> <p>As of today, the top two origin countries of Asian immigrants and naturalized citizens are India and China. The migration motivations and demographic characteristics of Asian immigrants have varied greatly over time and by country of origin - ranging from employment and family reunification to educational opportunities and humanitarian protection. </p> <p><strong>Indian and Chinese Naturalization Rates Per Year</strong></p> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4545984"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4546012"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div> <p>Ramon Saldanha, who immigrated to the United States from India in 1988, explains that the driving force behind his decision was simple: to get an education. “The only reason I was able to come to the United States is because I was accepted to grad school at the University of Detroit. I came on a student visa and was lucky that United States Steel was then willing to sponsor me for employment,” said Saldanha. </p> <p>This reality is not isolated to him, and certainly does not surprise demographers or immigration lawyers, who say that unlike Mexican immigrants, that path to citizenship for Asian immigrants is much easier as a result of company sponsorships.</p> <p>“High skilled employment opportunities in the United States continue to grow for people in Asian countries, mostly for high-tech and engineering, since the U.S. has a lack of employers in these fields” said corporate immigration lawyer Kane Vongsavanh of Berry Appleman and Lediden Law Firm, “Most of my corporate clients outsource to Indian and Chinese immigrants, many of which do come here to study in graduate schools and just wind up staying here.” </p> <p>Although these trends are staggering, the numbers can evolve over time, especially given the Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/06/politics/trump-visa-restrictions/index.html">rollback on H-1B visas</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/trump-immigration-walls/2020/10/31/e43453cc-09a3-11eb-991c-be6ead8c4018_story.html">restrictions on Mexican immigrants</a>.</p> <p>“The long-term effect of policies usually takes a few years,” Harith said. “It is likely that we will only see the effects of the Trump administration’s policies in our immigration numbers within the next 5 years.”</p> <p>Nonetheless, it is evident that these trends have sustained and arguably, thrived, over the past two decades – sending us a clear message of not just who we are, but what we are becoming.</p> </div> </article> <div class="row"> <!-- <div id="disqus_thread"></div> <script defer> (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
